# Deep Learning Examples
This repo contains examples of deep learning models using [tensoflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
* Regression model with a residual connection on structured data.
* Convolutional neural network and data augmentation on images.
* Computer vision using transfer learning.
* Two versions of a generative adversarial network that creates fake images.
* Auto encoder.
